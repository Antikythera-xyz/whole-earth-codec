                As a machinic interface between humans and nonhumans, the Whole Earth Codec creates a paradox of
                INTERDEPENDENCE: it at once removes human's from the loop, creating a nonhuman-machine fusion that is
                capable of self-regulating, yet this is actually instrumental in forming deeper interdependence between
                humans and nonhumans as a symbiotic ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Removing humans from being top-down stewards of the planet—making them to relinquish myopic control over
                earth systems—creates an opportunity for us to relearn intuitions of relating to the ecologies around
                us. We have to learn to tune in to the biosphere anew. In the nascent symbiosis of human, nonhumans, and
                machine, what new roles does each party take on? What new forms of relation arise?

                Humans are deeply entangled with the planet. The centuries following industrialization, however, reveal
                a willful ignorance of this fact: humans have unidirectionally exacted their needs on the planet with
                little regard for the downstream costs. The systemic extraction and manipulation of the environment
                through technological means has terraformed the planet in the image of one species, at the expense of
                all others. Recent extreme weather and rapid extinction caused by rising temperatures, however, make
                this entanglement impossible to ignore any longer.

            </p>

            <p>
                Curiously, this resurgent awareness of entanglement was made possible via the same technologization that
                led to this predicament in the first place. Technologically-mediated forms of sensing reveal previously
                hidden patterns and relations at scales far larger and smaller (and faster and slower) than those
                available to human senses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humanity is unthinkable outside of technology; human history is a history of technologization. As
                human-machine assemblages, we have been able to achieve previously impossible feats. Yet this
                human-driven technologization affects far more than just the human species. Our existence on this planet
                is also deeply enmeshed with nonhumans as well. While the term “nonhuman” most often refers to other
                living organisms (plants and animals), the nonhuman should also encompass all of the abiotic, yet
                agential, systems giving shape to the world: natural phenomena, geographic features, weather patterns.
                All of these entities are deeply affected by technology, and increasingly unthinkable outside of it. Why
                then do they have so little agency in its operation?

            <p>
                Rather than omitting nonhumans from the technological infrastructure which senses, processes, and
                modifies the planet, what if nonhumans were also enmeshed with these systems? What is technology thought
                outside of human instrumentality and control? Imaginaries of anthropocentric relations such as
                human-nonhuman or human-machine are pervasive, but there are fewer examples of what nonhuman-machine
                relationships could become. In “The Land That Owns Itself” by the Center for Democratic and
                Environmental Rights (CDER), land is transformed from human property to being self-owned by nature. This
                grants certain rights under the law, but how is such a concept actually realized? Projects such as
                terra0 put forth a framework for technologically-augmenting ecosystems such as forests so they may act
                as agents within in their own right. These, and other nonhuman-machine systems may present the key to
                grant nonhumans more agency in current dynamics.

            </p>

            <p>
                The recent emergence of novel machine learning architectures makes possible new possibilities for
                human-nonhuman-machine communication. As a multi-modal, planetary-scale foundation model, the Whole
                Earth Codec becomes such a vehicle for exactly this, allowing nonhumans to reassert their needs and
                become active agents in future technological evolution. The Codec bypasses existing binaries of
                top-down/bottom-up and serves as a distributed yet centralized model that hooks into earth systems and
                moves all parties towards more equilateral relations.

            </p>

            <p>
                It is able to do so by:

            <div class="px-8">
                <ol class="list-none">
                    <li> <span class="font-an text-lg">Aggregating</span>. The power of machine learning models lies in
                        the ability to compress massive amounts of data. Something like the totality of planetary
                        information has previously been incomprehensible to a single “mind,” but can now be compressed
                        and processed. Compression smooths away detail yet allows for larger contours to emerge;
                        statistical entanglement in the form of cross-modal embeddings becomes the means by which more
                        balanced planetary-scale entanglement might be achieved. Just like the Talk to the City project
                        by the AI Objectives Institute, the Codec can synthesize the needs, wants, and hopes of both
                        humans and nonhumans. By synthesizing these aggregate needs, it makes them newly comprehensible,
                        and thus, actionable. This process does not have to be viewed as a centralizing force; rather
                        the Codec could be subdivided into localized, specialized models that communicate with each
                        other.
                    </li>
                    <li> <span class="font-an text-lg">Connecting</span>. While species have always lived alongside one
                        another in dense webs of cause-and-effect, interspecies communication has never been possible.
                        By permitting information exchange across previously silo-ed populations, needs can be
                        expressed, greater awareness can be formed, and relationships can be strengthened. These
                        connections span nonhuman-nonhuman communities as well, instead of simply making human-nonhuman
                        communication possible.

                    </li>

                    <li> <span class="font-an text-lg">Evolving</span>. Initially, the Codec is able to preserve current
                        ecosystems and persist existing patterns by learning the intricacies of historical data of the
                        planet: how things have been. Planetary maintenance is thus the base step and an active task,
                        but the longterm goal of the Codec should be to instigate and guide continuous planetary
                        evolution, driven by novel nonhuman and human novel input. These objectives can be plural and
                        even contradictory: increasing biodiversity, lowering carbon impact, avoiding genetic
                        stagnation. Machine learning models are capable of higher-level multi-objective optimization
                        that is difficult for biotic brains, and the Codec could take the aggregate needs of all
                        planetary systems and inhabitants under consideration. For now, we can assume scarce resources
                        and dynamic change: not every organism can live yet we are interested in propelling the entire
                        ecosystem forward rather than maintaining the status quo. To cause change, the Codec puts forth
                        policy at different scales and temporalities: some may apply to a city or to the entire planet,
                        some may apply for a day or for 50 years, some may apply to fishermen or those who own diesel
                        cars.

                The Whole Earth Codec is not imposed on the earth from the outside, but rather dissolves itself into
                it.
                Planetary information is soaked into the Codec, which in turn dissolves itself into technological
                systems for earth systems management, rendering invisible the distinction between solute and
                solution.
                It is not passive but rather actively steers and is steered by the complex ecologies it is entangled
                with.

            <p class="pt-12">With the Whole Earth Codec taking on a new role in planetary relations—providing a
                layer of
                distributed cognition that is capable of planetary-scale aggregation and optimization—humans might
                cede myopic control over the earth. Existing attempts by humans to ameliorate issues such as
                ecological devastation have been limited by their informatic shortcomings, resulting in siloed
                strategies that flatten nuanced interdependencies, or mere resignment in the face of the sheer
                complexity of planetary-scale crises at which planetary crises like climate change unfold. The
                unique affordances of the Codec might enable us to move beyond thus-far unsuccessful attempts to
                make meaningful change at scale. </p>
            <p>Current ecosystem management paradigms seek to maintain long-term sustainability while fulfilling
                human needs. Unable to grapple with the complexities of ecological systems, blunt human policies
                that seek to control nature often lead to unintended consequences like a decline in ecosystem
                resilience. More reparative strategies such as conservation or rewilding belie an undercurrent of
                stasis or reversion, respectively. Conservation techniques, which seek to ward off extinction and
                biodiversity loss, usually take the form of protecting specific species. They aim for survival-level
                recuperation without significantly infringing upon human behavior; think wildlife corridors along
                miles of freeway. More radical policies of ecological restoration like rewilding seek to reduce
                human influence on natural ecosystems, trading human interventions in favor of natural processes.
                Yet this line of thinking is also misguided, reifying a nature-culture divide and a hinging on a
                fantasy of return to some untouched, unblemished slate. Rather, we should be charting a way forward
                with technology that scaffolds new possibilities for humans and nonhumans alike. By understanding
                the multi-dimensional relations on the earth, the Codec could address challenges within ecosystem
                management of poor monitoring or unintended effects. It could surface sites of ecological
                devastation and indeed reveal new forms of devastation that we currently do not understand. Of
                course, rather than simply revealing such issues, for humans to act upon (or not), it should wield
                more agential power in directly ameliorating said issues. </p>

            <p>
                Currently, both state and non-state actors are tasked with setting and enforcing ecological limits
                that determine what humans can and cannot do to the earth. These limits are derived from models
                constructed from years of piecemeal and laborious research, propagating slowly through institutions
                and policy. The result is often fragmented and siloed, lacking the broad scale and scope through
                which planetary limits must be conceived.
            </p>

            <p>
                Related to the difficulty of determining limits is the challenge of articulating them. There are
                more slippery, ill-defined ways that resource extraction is impacting the planet than can be easily
                distilled to human-governable metrics. Existing institutions are not capable of overseeing fuzzy
                restrictions that are context-specific or changing, and any enshrined metric is inflexible and
                subject to Goodhart's Law.
            </p>

            <p>
                While all of these efforts are commendable, they crucially lack enforceability. The model exists
                alongside the world, its enforceability subject to the whims of short-term political cycles and
                anthropocentric short-sightedness. From the Paris Agreement to more recent global pacts made at COP
                to limit global temperature to below 2 °C over pre-industrial levels have largely been
                unenforceable, as the world remains not on track to achieve targets. Smaller scale regulations
                within industries like mining, fishing, or drilling are overly reliant on self-reporting and
                spot-checks.

                The Codec attempts to move beyond this trap of enforceability. Rather than the model sitting
                alongside the world, here the model is directly integrated within the processes guiding its
                modificaiton: integrated into design tools rather than simply imposed from the outside. Much like
                GPT has been integrated into a variety of language-based applications, the Codec could embed
                ecological intelligence within the tools used to give shape to the world, from architecture design
                software, to fishery management, or mining and resource extraction tools. This allows governance to
                be integrated into the processes of modifying and harvesting from the earth, rather than imposed
                from the outside as a suggested and difficult to enforce limit. This could take the form of
                automatic constraints built into design tools, limiting the possibility space for design to better
                match the contours of complex, multivariate ecosystems as modeled in simulation. Through its
                statistical processing, it can reveal adverse impacts on parts of the ecosystem and identify
                necessary limitations that must be placed. These limitations could be flexible, applied not
                uniformly throughout a population but attuned to specifics. Through its perpetual sensing and
                processing of data, the Codec could maintain its open-ended governance of ecological limits.

                    2050. Rather than pre-planned static routes and seasonal quotas, the Codec generates dynamic
                    “fisherity” maps and schedules that mitigate destructive overfishing practices.
                </p>
                <p>These maps and
                    schedules indicate the optimal time periods, geographic zones, and sustainable catch volumes for
                    fishing activity in a given area based on real-time data and predictive modeling of factors
                    related
                    to the overall marine ecosystem health.</p>
                <p>
                    Some major commercial fishing nations refuse to adopt the Codec’s dynamic fisherity system. They
                    continue to operate on their traditional pre-scheduled routes and fixed quotas in the
                    territories
                    they claim economic exclusion over.

                    The Codec detects that these rogue nations are overfishing and depleting stocks beyond
                    sustainable
                    levels, the Codec lacks any real enforcement capability for actors that deviate from the
                    schedule.
                    Instead, it automatically re-routes legal fishing activity away from the overfished areas,
                    allowing
                    them to recover over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is criticism from international fishermen and organizations who have agreed to follow the
                    Codec's fisherity system. They feel it is unfair that they are forced to abide by the maps and
                    fishing rules while the rogue nations continue to overfish without accountability.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Surprisingly, rogue fishing nations see their economic yields diminish rapidly compared to
                    fisherity-compliant competitors who are able to access more productive waters. Some rogue
                    fishermen
                    retaliate by attempting to physically disable or spoof some of the Codec’s offshore sensor
                    networks.

                <p>
                    Over time, adherence to the Codec's fisherity system becomes a commercial advantage and
                    reputational necessity for fishing operators wanting to access prime areas replenished through
                    sustainable practices. The rogue nations find themselves frozen out, stuck plundering
                    increasingly barren waters.

            The Whole Earth Codec thus creates the paradox of:

                <li>enabling a self-regulating ecosystem that removes humans from the loop

        <p>
            Removing humans from their top-down and often myopic control of ecological systems presents a new
            opportunity for a symbiotic interdependence amongst all parties inhabiting the planet. When we are
            barred from making unilateral decisions about earth systems, we become more attuned to the ecologies
            around us and more beholden to planetary needs. What might this new entanglement of human, nonhuman,
            and planetary systems look like?

        </video>
        <p>Initially, the Codec spreads awareness among humans as we tune in more to the ecosystem around us. As
            human-nonhuman communication proliferates, we become more aware of the needs of nonhumans and the
            ecosystem. Needs can be directly expressed in human-legible terms, like a tree specifying that it
            needs to be watered, but new forms of expressing desires may also take shape. Awareness here could
            encompass both directly communicated needs and also more general “feeling” honed from being more
            interconnected with the complex ecological systems around us. Beyond greater awareness alone, which
            relies on human willingness, the Codec also enforces stricter imperatives around respecting
            ecological boundaries. Humans are more beholden to planetary restrictions and rub up against the
            specific impacts of their actions.</p>

        <p>The Codec could, for example, impose particular constraints around supply chains involved in the
            extraction, manufacturing, and purchasing of goods. This does not make planetary restrictions simply
            the problem of individuals: when corporations want to build something that levies a cost on the
            planet, the Codec would embed constraints into the design tools themselves. As the cause-and-effect
            of our actions enter our awareness, especially as we hit hard limitations, we reach a deeper level
            of understanding of our interdependence on the planet around us.</p>

        <p>
            The process of humans ceding ecological agency to the Codec will not be smooth but rather encounter
            messy intricacies. As the global response to climate change has demonstrated, human behavior is
            difficult to change even with indisputable knowledge that change must happen. Traditional cultural
            legacies should also be taken into consideration by the Codec in the process of need aggregation;
            like permission for indigenous people in Alaska to continue whaling, the policy set by the Codec
            should arrive from a process of negotiation. This negotiation must occur between human desires and
            that of nonhuman organisms and systems. A delicate balance must be struck between our desires and
            ecological imperatives. Any such imperatives are not imposed at the end but rather built into the
            processes through which our desires manifest. As a technological interface plugged into human and
            nonhuman communities alike, the Whole Earth Codec creates a new interdependence between biotic and
            abiotic organisms, systems, and lifeforms.

            Ultimately, the Whole Earth Codec suggests a new symbiosis between humans, nonhumans, and machines.
            What might this symbiosis look like? What new forms might it propel us towards? The evolution of the
            biosphere has always been driven by an evolution of information processing. The addition of the
            Codec’s technological interleaving is thus not the sudden imposition of an alien computation onto
            the planet but rather the latest evolution of the planet’s ability to process information about
            itself. Published in 1995, John Maynard Smith and
            Eörs Szathmáry’s seminal evolutionary biology work, “The Major Transitions of Evolution,” puts forth
            a hypothesis for why evolution has led to ever more complex lifeforms.

            <source src="../videos/blue_small/transition.mov" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <p>
            From prokaryotes to eukaryotes, protists to multicellular organisms, individuals to colonies, each
            major transition is predicated on both a new unit of individuality as well as a new method of
            information processing. These more complex methods of information transmission allow for smaller
            entities to come together to form larger entities, specializing in their abilities as they become
            part of a greater whole. Eventually, the smaller entities are unable to replicate without the larger
            individual, and the fundamental “unit” of the individual changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            This theory gives us an idea for what a Codec-induced symbiosis may become: the co-evolution of
            human and nonhuman organisms towards more complex, higher-order forms. This would involve the human
            and nonhuman, nature and machine, at the level of individuals, colonies, and systems. Perhaps the
            Codec would enable a new form of hereditary information transmission that is able to encode more
            complexity than any medium thus far, thus allowing for a new major transition in evolution.
            Organisms of ascending complexity may emerge through endosymbiosis, each consisting of biotic,
            abiotic, and machinic organs.

        </p>

        <p>
            These new organisms emerge as new forms of coordination become possible via the Codec. By opening up
            communication between humans and nonhumans, nonhumans and nonhumans, and every organism with the
            machine, the communication medium itself expands recursively as communicating parties do. As complex
            concepts can be expressed via information exchange, they can in turn bootstrap higher complexity by
            conveying further meaning in more compressed and efficient language. In turn, this allows for more
            efficient coordination between parties, whether human or nonhuman. New and shifting groupings,
            colonies, assemblages, and nested hierarchies take form fluidly, mediated by the Codec. The notion
            of the individual is blurred and under constant transformation. Through informatic interweaving of
            human and nonhumans, perhaps the planet itself emerges as a veritable individual with its own goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the beginning, a coordinating group may contain generalized members, such that each one is
            capable of doing all tasks. However, since all organisms have different capabilities, some are
            naturally more adept than others within their niches. Specialized subgroups slowly appear. This
            specialization occurs at different levels: just as biological organisms are composed of organs,
            subdivided into cells, subdivided into organelles, the larger organisms can also be part of teams
            within clans within populations. More fluid compositions enabled by the Codec could allow for
            dynamic recompositions at every level. These symbiotic groupings themselves will undergo processes
            of specialization and perhaps speciation. With the pooled knowledge of all these entities in
            correspondence, new ways of thinking, coordinating, organizing, modeling, and understanding might
            develop.

            Under the imminent threat of climate change, visions for the future of the planet have been limited
            to mere disaster aversion. There has been little opportunity to articulate future-looking policy of
            what the earth could become outside of this restrictive vision. From carbon dioxide removal through
            sequestration to solar radiation modification via aerosol particles, large-scale technological
            visions for the planet are focused on mitigating the effects of climate change. Holly Jean Buck
            discusses the false binary of geoengineering: between industrial, extractivist technosolutionism on
            one hand and restorative climate justice and degrowth on the other. The myth of this binary prevents
            us from viewing nature as always inexorably intertwined with the attempts of humans of nonhumans
            alike to recursively modify it; technology is just another agent at play within the dynamics of the
            planet.
