                As a machinic interface between humans and nonhumans, the Whole Earth Codec creates a paradox of
                INTERDEPENDENCE: it at once removes humans from the loop, creating a nonhuman-machine fusion that is
                capable of self-regulating, yet this becomes instrumental in forming a deeper interdependence between
                humans and nonhumans as symbionts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Removing humans from their position as top-down stewards of the planet—making them to relinquish myopic control over
                earth systems—creates an opportunity for us to relearn intuitions of relating to the ecologies around
                us. We have to learn to tune in to the biosphere anew. In the nascent symbiosis of human, nonhumans, and
                machine, what new roles does each party play? What new forms of relation arise?

            <p>
                Humans are deeply entangled with the planet. The centuries following industrialization, however, reveal
                a willful ignorance of this fact: humans have unidirectionally exacted their needs on the planet with
                little regard for downstream costs. The systematic extraction and manipulation of the environment
                through technological means has terraformed the planet in the image of one species, at the expense of
                all others. Recent extreme weather and rapid extinction caused by rising temperatures make
                this entanglement impossible to ignore any longer.

            </p>

            <p>
                This resurgent awareness of entanglement is only made possible through the same technology that
                led to this predicament in the first place. Technologically-mediated forms of sensing reveal previously
                hidden patterns and relations at scales far larger and smaller (and faster and slower) than those
                available to human senses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humanity is unthinkable outside of technology; human history is a history of technologization. As
                human-machine assemblages, we have achieved previously impossible feats. Yet this
                human-driven technologization affects far more than just the human species. Our existence on this planet
                is also deeply enmeshed with nonhumans. While the term “nonhuman” often refers to other
                living organisms (such as plants and animals), the nonhuman also encompasses all of the abiotic yet
                agential systems giving shape to the world: natural phenomena, geographic features, weather patterns.
                All of these entities are deeply affected by technology and increasingly unthinkable outside of it. Why
                then do they have so little agency in its operation?
            </p>
            <video class="w-full row-span-full col-span-full py-12" autoplay muted loop

            <p>
                Rather than omitting nonhumans from the technological infrastructure which senses, processes, and
                modifies the planet, what if nonhumans were also enmeshed with these systems? What is technology
                outside of human instrumentality and control? Imaginaries of anthropocentric relations such as
                human-nonhuman or human-machine are pervasive, but there are fewer examples of what nonhuman-machine
                relationships could become. In “The Land That Owns Itself” by the Center for Democratic and
                Environmental Rights (CDER), land is transformed from human property to being self-owned by nature. This
                grants certain rights under the law, but how is self-ownership actually realized? Projects such as
                terra0 put forth a framework for technologically-augmenting ecosystems such as forests so they may act
                as agents within their own right. These and other nonhuman-machine systems present the beginnings for
                granting nonhumans more agency.

            </p>

            <p>
                As a multi-modal, planetary-scale foundation model, the Whole
                Earth Codec becomes a vehicle for human-nonhuman-machine communication, allowing nonhumans to reassert their needs and
                become active agents in co-determined technological evolution. The Codec bypasses existing binaries of
                top-down/bottom-up and serves as a distributed yet centralized model that hooks into earth systems and
                moves all parties towards more equilateral relations.

                    <li> <span class="font-an text-md sm:text-base">Aggregating</span>. Machine learning
                        models wield the
                        ability to compress massive amounts of data. The totality of planetary
                        information has been previously incomprehensible to a single “mind,” but can now be compressed
                        and processed by a synthetic one. Compression smooths away detail yet allows for larger contours to emerge:
                        statistical entanglement in the form of cross-modal embeddings becomes the means through which more
                        balanced planetary-scale entanglement might be achieved. Just like the Talk to the City project
                        by the AI Objectives Institute, the Codec synthesizes the needs, wants, and hopes of both
                        humans and nonhumans. By aggregating these needs, it makes them newly comprehensible
                        and thus actionable. This process does not have to be viewed as a centralizing force; rather
                        the Codec could be subdivided into localized, speciated models that communicate with each
                        other.

                    <li> <span class="font-an text-md sm:text-base">Connecting</span>. While species have always lived
                        alongside one
                        another in dense webs of cause-and-effect, interspecies communication has never been possible.
                        By permitting information exchange across previously silo-ed populations, needs can be
                        expressed, greater awareness can be formed, and relationships can be strengthened. These
                        connections can span nonhuman-nonhuman communities as well instead of simply bridging humans and nonhumans.

                    <li> <span class="font-an text-md sm:text-base">Evolving</span>. Initially, the Codec is able to
                        preserve current
                        ecosystems and persist existing patterns by learning the intricacies of historical data of the
                        planet: how things have been. Planetary maintenance is thus the base step,
                        but the longterm goal of the Codec should be to guide continuous planetary
                        evolution, driven by novel nonhuman and human input. These objectives can be plural and
                        contradictory: increasing biodiversity, lowering carbon impact, avoiding genetic
                        stagnation. Machine learning models are capable of multi-objective optimization
                        that is difficult for biotic brains, and the Codec could take the aggregate needs of all
                        planetary systems and inhabitants under consideration. For now, we can assume scarce resources
                        and dynamic change: not every organism can live, yet we are interested in propelling the entire
                        ecosystem forward rather than maintaining the status quo. To effect change, the Codec puts forth
                        policy at different scales and temporalities: some may apply to a city or to the entire planet,
                        some may apply for a day or for 50 years, some may apply to fishermen or those who own diesel
                        cars.

                The Whole Earth Codec is not imposed on the earth from the outside but rather permeates it in the way 
                that all technological instrumentation has.
                Planetary information is soaked into the Codec, which in turn dissolves into techno-ecosystems,
                blurring the line between solute and
                solution.
                It actively steers and is steered by the complex ecologies it is entangled
                with.

            <p class="pt-12">With the Whole Earth Codec taking on a new role in planetary relations—providing a
                layer of
                distributed cognition that is capable of planetary-scale aggregation and optimization—humans can
                cede myopic control over the earth. Existing attempts by humans to ameliorate issues such as
                ecological devastation have been limited by their informatic shortcomings, resulting in siloed
                strategies that flatten nuanced interdependencies, or resignation in the face of the sheer
                complexity of how planetary-scale crises like climate change unfold. The
                unique affordances of the Codec might enable us to move beyond previously unsuccessful attempts to
                make meaningful change at scale. </p>
            <p>Current ecosystem management paradigms seek to maintain long-term sustainability while fulfilling
                human needs. Unable to grapple with the complexities of ecological systems, blunt human policies
                that seek to control nature often lead to unintended consequences like a decline in ecological
                resilience. More reparative strategies such as conservation or rewilding belie an undercurrent of
                stasis or reversion, respectively. Conservation techniques, which seek to ward off extinction and
                biodiversity loss, usually take the form of protecting specific species. They aim for survival-level
                recuperation without significantly infringing upon human behavior; think wildlife corridors along
                miles of freeway. More radical policies of ecological restoration like rewilding seek to reduce
                human influence on natural ecosystems, trading human interventions in favor of natural processes.
                Yet this line of thinking is also misguided, reifying a nature-culture divide and a hinging on a
                fantasy of return to some unblemished slate. Rather, we should chart a way forward
                with technology that scaffolds new possibilities for humans and nonhumans alike. By understanding
                the multi-dimensional relations on the earth, the Codec could address challenges within ecosystem
                management such as poor monitoring or unintended effects. It could surface sites of ecological
                devastation and indeed reveal new forms of devastation that we currently do not understand. Of
                course, rather than simply revealing such issues for humans to act upon, it could also wield
                more agency to directly ameliorate these issues. </p>

                Currently, both state and non-state actors are tasked with setting and enforcing ecological limits
                that determine what humans can do to the earth. These limits are derived from models
                constructed from years of piecemeal and laborious research, propagating slowly through institutions
                and policy. The result is often fragmented, lacking the broad scope through
                which planetary limits must be conceived.
            </p>

            <p>
                Related to the difficulty of determining limits is the challenge of articulating them. There are
                more slippery, ill-defined ways that resource extraction is impacting the planet than can be easily
                distilled to human-governable metrics. Existing institutions are not capable of overseeing fuzzy
                restrictions that are context-specific or fluidly changing, and any enshrined metric becomes inflexible and
                subject to Goodhart's Law.
            </p>

            <p>
                While all of these efforts are commendable, they lack enforceability: they are subject to the whims of political cycles and
                anthropocentric short-sightedness. The models which detect harm cannot action upon their findings.

                to limit global temperature to below 2 °C over pre-industrial levels have largely been
                unenforceable, as the world remains off track to achieve targets. Smaller scale regulations
                within industries like mining, fishing, or drilling are overly reliant on self-reporting and

                The Codec attempts to move beyond this unenforceability. Rather than reamining severed
                from the world, the model is directly integrated within its processes: 
                ecological limits build into design tools rather than imposed from the outside. Much like
                GPT has been integrated into a variety of language-based applications, the Codec could embed
                ecological intelligence within the tools used to give shape to the world, from architecture design

                posthoc as difficult-to-enforce limitations outside of design processes. This could take the form of
                automatic constraints built into design tools, limiting the possibility space to better
                match the contours of complex, multivariate ecosystems as modeled in simulation. Through its
                statistical processing, the Codec can reveal adverse impacts on parts of the ecosystem and identify

            encompass both directly communicated needs and also more general “feeling” honed from being more

                quadratic mechanism nonetheless allocates a portion of Codec funds towards the build-out of new

            The process of humans ceding ecological agency to the Codec will encounter
            messy intricacies. As the global response to climate change has demonstrated, human behavior is
            difficult to change even with indisputable knowledge that change must happen. Traditional cultural
            legacies should also be taken into consideration by the Codec in the process of need aggregation;
            like permission for indigenous people in Alaska to continue whaling, the policy set by the Codec
            should arrive from a process of context-specific negotiation.<span class="inline-flex items-center">

                be objectively sensed and transduced for the codec to understand. Some on the forum worry about the
                extent of how much the Codec really understands human needs and desires and are skeptical that the Codec
                may be over prioritizing the nonhuman. Others are critics of how the Codec reinforces nation-state
                control, by notifying governments instead of the local people whose lives would be impacted by new
                mining operations. The authors of the proposal draft include updates using the feedback and insights
                gained from community deliberations.

            <p>
                The Codec generates a synthesized proposal based on its original build-out proposal with the improvement
                proposal. The new proposal suggests core changes to the Codec's extraction protocol, rerouting a portion
                of the mining operations from Australia to Chile. In addition, the proposal introduces a protocol for
                benefits sharing and tasks regional nodes to notify local communities impacted by new network
                build-outs, and strongly encourages bottom-up access and contribution to the Codec.

            <p>
                Although the Codec's latest proposal makes concessions by redistributing some mining operations to
                Chile, mining plans in Australia are still put into motion. The community organizers in Australia are
                baffled. Considering all the outrage against extraction in Australia that was comprehensively documented
                in their proposal, how could the Codec still decide to move forward to mine in Australia?
            <p>
                The build-out plan in Eastern Europe is successful after having gone through several proposal
                iterations. A percentage of profits from the applications built using high resolution bioacoustic data
                in Europe are partially redistributed into a trust. Funds in the trust are reserved for maintenance and
                future build-outs of the Codec while the remaining portion is redistributed to sites of extraction in
                Australia and Chile. These funds go towards land rehabilitation and potential roll-out proposals for
                local communities to coordinate new network build-out through grassroots efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                After altering the extractivist protocols, the Codec highly suggests grassroots efforts to build-out the
                network, especially in resource-rich regions that may be highly demanded for extraction. That's because
                areas that the Codec indicates as optimal for resource extraction are often the same sites that lack a
                robust sensor network that allow the Codec to make more meaningful and equitable decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bottom-up build outs proliferate. It becomes practice to build-out small scale sensor networks with high
                quality sensors in frequent extraction zones to ensure the Codec is performing mutual considerations to
                all stakeholders involved, human and nonhuman.

            Ultimately, the Whole Earth Codec suggests a new symbiosis between humans, nonhumans, and machines.
            What might this symbiosis look like? What new forms might it propel us towards? The evolution of the
            biosphere has always been driven by an evolution of information processing. The addition of the
            Codec’s technological interleaving is not the sudden imposition of an alien computation onto
            the planet but rather the latest evolution of the planet’s ability to process information about
            itself. Published in 1995, John Maynard Smith and
            Eörs Szathmáry’s seminal evolutionary biology work, “The Major Transitions of Evolution,” puts forth
            a hypothesis for why evolution has led to ever more complex lifeforms.

        <p>
            From prokaryotes to eukaryotes, protists to multicellular organisms, individuals to colonies, each
            major transition is predicated on both a new unit of individuality as well as a new method of
            information processing. These more complex methods of information transmission allow for smaller
            entities to come together to form larger entities, specializing in their abilities as they become
            part of a greater whole. Eventually, the smaller entities are unable to replicate without the larger
            individual, and the fundamental “unit” of the individual changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            This theory gives us an idea for what a Codec-induced symbiosis may become: the co-evolution of
            human and nonhuman organisms towards more complex, higher-order forms. This would involve the human
            and nonhuman, nature and machine, at the level of individuals, colonies, and systems. Perhaps the
            Codec would enable a new form of hereditary information transmission that is able to encode more
            complexity than any medium thus far, allowing for a new major transition in evolution.
            Organisms of ascending complexity may emerge through endosymbiosis, each consisting of biotic,
            abiotic, and machinic organs.

        </p>

        <p>
            These new organisms emerge as new forms of coordination become possible via the Codec. By opening up
            communication between humans and nonhumans, nonhumans and nonhumans, and every organism with the
            machine, the communication medium itself evolves as communicating parties do. As complex
            concepts can be expressed via information exchange, they can in turn bootstrap higher complexity by
            conveying further meaning in more articulate language. In turn, this allows for more
            efficient coordination between parties, whether human or nonhuman. New and shifting groupings,
            colonies, assemblages, and nested hierarchies take form, mediated by the Codec. The notion
            of the individual is blurred and under constant transformation. Through the informatic interweaving of
            human and nonhumans, perhaps the planet itself emerges as a super-organism with its own goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the beginning, a coordinating group may contain generalized members, such that each one is
            capable of doing all tasks. However, since all organisms have different capabilities, some are
            naturally more adept than others within their niches. Specialized subgroups slowly appear. This
            specialization occurs at different levels: just as biological organisms are composed of organs,
            subdivided into cells, subdivided into organelles, the larger organisms can also be part of teams
            within clans within populations. More fluid compositions enabled by the Codec could allow for
            dynamic recompositions at every level. These symbiotic groupings themselves will undergo processes
            of specialization and perhaps speciation. With the pooled knowledge of all these entities in
            correspondence, new ways of thinking, coordinating, organizing, modeling, and understanding might
            develop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under the imminent threat of climate change, visions for the future of the planet have been limited
            to mere disaster aversion. There has been little opportunity to articulate future-looking policy of
            what the earth could become outside of this restrictive vision. From carbon dioxide removal through
            sequestration to solar radiation modification via aerosol particles, large-scale technological
            visions for the planet are focused on mitigating the effects of climate change. Holly Jean Buck
            discusses the false binary of geoengineering: between industrial, extractivist technosolutionism on
            one hand and restorative climate justice and degrowth on the other. The myth of this binary prevents
            us from viewing nature as always inexorably intertwined with the attempts of humans and nonhumans
            alike to recursively modify it; technology is just another agent at play within the dynamics of the
            planet.
        </p>

        <p>The Whole Earth Codec becomes the new solvent for human-nonhuman-machine interdependence at planetary scale.</p>
